    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding the complexity of an object and exposing only the essential features. It provides a simplified and generalized interface to the user, which makes the object easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a car. A user doesn't need to know the details of how the engine, transmission, and other components work. All they need to know is how to operate the car. They use the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brakes to drive the car, without having to worry about the internal workings of the car. In this case, the car is an abstraction of the underlying components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated but can have methods with no implementation or abstract methods. An abstract method is a method with only the method signature, but no body, and is used to define a method that must be implemented by a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces are similar to abstract classes, but all methods in an interface are abstract. They define a set of methods that must be implemented by a class that implements the interface. In this way, they provide a standardized interface to the user, regardless of the implementation details of the implementing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is important in OOP because it allows for separation of concerns and simplifies the use of objects. It allows the user to interact with an object at a high level, without having to worry about the details of the underlying implementation."

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the internal details and complexity of an object and only exposing the essential features or functionalities to the outside world. In other words, abstraction focuses on what an object does instead of how it does it. It allows us to create a simple and easy-to-use interface for the user while hiding the complex implementation details. Abstraction is achieved in OOP using abstract classes, interfaces, and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a car. The car is an object that has several internal parts such as an engine, transmission, suspension, brakes, etc. However, for the end-user, these internal details are not relevant. All they care about is that the car can be driven, and they can control it using the steering wheel, brakes, and accelerator. Here, the car is an example of abstraction. It hides the internal details and only exposes the essential features required to operate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of bundling data and methods that operate on that data in a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is only accessible through well-defined public methods. It allows us to create a protective shield around the object's data and methods, preventing any external code from directly accessing or modifying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a bank account. A bank account is an object that has several properties, such as account number, balance, and account holder's name. The user can perform various operations on the account, such as deposit, withdraw, check balance, etc. However, the user should not be able to modify the account number or balance directly. Encapsulation ensures that the account's properties are only accessible through well-defined methods such as deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance(). Here, the bank account is an example of encapsulation. It bundles the data and methods into a single unit, ensuring that the internal state of the account is protected and only accessible through well-defined public methods."

    "The abc (Abstract Base Classes) module in Python provides infrastructure for defining and using abstract base classes.\n",

    "An abstract base class is a class that defines an interface but not its implementation. It provides a blueprint for other classes to follow. Abstract base classes are used to define a common API for a set of subclasses that have similar behaviors. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly and need to be subclassed to provide implementations for their methods.\n",
